## WRK541: Real World Code Migration with Github Copilot Agent Mode

If you will be delivering this session, check the [session-delivery-sources](./session-delivery-resources/) folder for slides, scripts, and other resources.

### Session Description

- **Who is this for**: Any technologist that is looking to apply AI pair-programming techniques with GitHub Copilot to perform challenging work like migrating or translating from one programming language to another.
- **What you'll learn**: You'll use advanced GitHub Copilot techniques that are specifically useful when translating projects in different programming languages, as well as the different modes GitHub Copilot has to offer.
- **What you'll build**: An HTTP API that uses Rust with full compatibility from the original HTTP API written in Python.


### üß† Learning Outcomes

In this workshop, you will:

  - Learn the differences about each of GitHub Copilot Modes, when to use each one, best practices and tools to help you get the most out of your interactions.
  - Understand the Differences Between Python and Rust for Web Development
  Learn the key differences in syntax, libraries, and frameworks when transitioning from Python's FastAPI to Rust's actix-web.
  - Implement JSON Serialization and Deserialization in Rust
  Gain hands-on experience using the serde library to handle JSON data, ensuring compatibility with the original Python API.
  - Develop and Validate Incremental Endpoints in Rust
  Practice creating and testing individual endpoints iteratively, ensuring correctness and alignment with the original Python API.
  - Optimize Performance and Identify Bottlenecks in Rust
  Learn to analyze and address potential performance issues, such as redundant file serialization, while building a production-ready Rust application.


## üì£ Prerequisites

Before joining the workshop, there is only one prerequisite: you must have a public GitHub account. All resources, dependencies, and data are part of the repository itself. Make sure you have your GitHub Copilot license, trial, or the free version.

## Responsible AI 

Microsoft is committed to helping our customers use our AI products responsibly, sharing our learnings, and building trust-based partnerships through tools like Transparency Notes and Impact Assessments. Many of these resources can be found at [https://aka.ms/RAI](https://aka.ms/RAI).
Microsoft‚Äôs approach to responsible AI is grounded in our‚ÄØAI principles of fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.

Large-scale natural language, image, and speech models - like the ones used in this sample - can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive, in turn causing harms. Please consult the [Azure OpenAI service Transparency note](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text) to be informed about risks and limitations.

The recommended approach to mitigating these risks is to include a safety system in your architecture that can detect and prevent harmful behavior. [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) provides an independent layer of protection, able to detect harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services. Azure AI Content Safety includes text and image APIs that allow you to detect material that is harmful. Within Azure AI Foundry portal, the Content Safety service allows you to view, explore and try out sample code for detecting harmful content across different modalities. The following [quickstart documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-text?tabs=visual-studio%2Clinux&pivots=programming-language-rest) guides you through making requests to the service.

Another aspect to take into account is the overall application performance. With multi-modal and multi-models applications, we consider performance to mean that the system performs as you and your users expect, including not generating harmful outputs. It's important to assess the performance of your overall application using [Performance and Quality and Risk and Safety evaluators](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in). You also have the ability to create and evaluate with [custom evaluators](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/evaluate-sdk#custom-evaluators).

You can evaluate your AI application in your development environment using the [Azure AI Evaluation SDK](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/index.html). Given either a test dataset or a target, your generative AI application generations are quantitatively measured with built-in evaluators or custom evaluators of your choice. To get started with the azure ai evaluation sdk to evaluate your system, you can follow the [quickstart guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/flow-evaluate-sdk). Once you execute an evaluation run, you can [visualize the results in Azure AI Foundry portal ](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/evaluate-flow-results).
