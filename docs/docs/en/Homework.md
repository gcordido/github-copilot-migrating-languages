# Homework

Congratulations on completing the workshop! To solidify your learning and explore additional concepts, here are some homework exercises and extended projects.

### Take Home Challenge: Deploying the application on Azure

If you have achieved all previous steps including the containerization, try
deploying your application on Azure. For this you will need an Azure account
and [the GitHub Copilot for Azure
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot)
which will help you ask questions and get guidance for deployment.

1. Use `@azure` after signing into your Azure account to ask how to deploy the
   containerized Rust application
1. Use one of the suggested services for deployment, for example, Azure
   Container Apps, to deploy the container
1. Verify your container is deployed and working

By the end, ensure you cleanup and remove any and all resources to prevent
unneeded cloud charges to your account.
