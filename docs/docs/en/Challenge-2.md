# Bonus Challenges

### Challenge 2: Creating a Makefile to interact with the Rust project.

> [!NOTE]
> You may have a `Makefile` already created by Copilot as part of this
> workshop. If that is the case, just make the updates necessary, otherwise
> create a new one.

Create a useful `Makefile` to make it easier to interact with the Rust project.
Use GitHub Copilot in Agent mode for this challenge. Use Agent mode to achieve
the following:

1. Create a Makefile with build, build-container, test, and run targets
1. Make the `Makefile` produce a useful help menu when no targets are passed in
1. Explore additional targets like release-build and similar that GitHub
   Copilot might suggest in Ask mode
