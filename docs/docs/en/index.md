# Real World Code Migration with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

## A 55-minute interactive workshop

### Perform a challenging migration to a completely different language

- **Who is this for**: Any technologist that is looking to apply AI pair-programming techniques with GitHub Copilot to perform challenging work like migrating or translating from one programming language to another.
- **What you'll learn**: You'll use advanced GitHub Copilot techniques that are specifically useful when translating projects in different programming languages, as well as the different modes GitHub Copilot has to offer.
- **What you'll build**: An HTTP API that uses Rust with full compatibility from the original HTTP API written in Python.

## Learning Objectives 

In this workshop, you will:

  - Learn the differences about each of GitHub Copilot Modes, when to use each one, best practices and tools to help you get the most out of your interactions.
  - Understand the Differences Between Python and Rust for Web Development
  Learn the key differences in syntax, libraries, and frameworks when transitioning from Python's FastAPI to Rust's actix-web.
  - Implement JSON Serialization and Deserialization in Rust
  Gain hands-on experience using the serde library to handle JSON data, ensuring compatibility with the original Python API.
  - Develop and Validate Incremental Endpoints in Rust
  Practice creating and testing individual endpoints iteratively, ensuring correctness and alignment with the original Python API.
  - Optimize Performance and Identify Bottlenecks in Rust
  Learn to analyze and address potential performance issues, such as redundant file serialization, while building a production-ready Rust application.

## :mega: Prerequisites

Before joining the workshop, there is only one prerequisite: you must have a public GitHub account. All resources, dependencies, and data are part of the repository itself. Make sure you have your GitHub Copilot license, trial, or the free version.
