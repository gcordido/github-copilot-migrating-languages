# Bonus Challenges

Ready for an extra challenge? This section presents advanced scenarios that will push the boundaries of what you have so far accomplished.

## Challenge 1: Containerizing the project

Containerize this project so that users can run it in other environments
without having to install and compile dependencies.

You can start with Agent mode to create the Dockerfile, then switch over to
Edit mode when making updates to the Dockerfile. Finally, switch over to Agent
mode to get guidance verifying the container.

1. Ask Copilot to help you generate a Dockerfile to containerize the Rust
   project
1. Review the Dockerfile created, optionally switch to Edit mode to make
   specific changes to the file
1. Use Agent mode to verify the container builds and can run

Make adjustments as needed to ensure the container works.
